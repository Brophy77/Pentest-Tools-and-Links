# Pentest-Tools-and-Links
Repository for Pentest Tools and Links

Personal copies of various Penetration Testing Tools for ease of locating. Along with links to various sites and resources.

This will contain some tools that I regularly use for HTB, THM, VulnHub and related CTF sites for quick reference and availability. Associated tools and scripts will be fully credited to their respective authors, referencing their related repositories.

This is a work in progress and will grow and change as needs require.
